# A Noise Robust Image Reconstruction using Slice Aware Cycle Interpolator Network for Parallel Imaging in MRI
Pytorch implementation of cycle interpolator network for parallel imaging in MRI. 

## Usage
The default setting: number of ACS = 8, reduction factor (R) = 2, data path (dir_path) = 'home/user/', epochs = 1000
